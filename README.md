# TNN_Image_Chess
This repository contains all code required to run the Transcoding Neural Network (TNN). We demonstrate that, on image classification tasks (MNIST and CIFAR-10), the Biological Processing Unit (BPU) achieves better performance than a size-matched MLP. On chess tasks, TNN outperforms a Transformer baseline with a larger parameter count.
